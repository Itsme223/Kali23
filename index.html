        <h2 class="animate title-word-1">My Dork</h2>
        <p>Since the day we started dating, i knew there was something special about you. It could have been our awkward first date, where i thought you hated me the whole time :D. It could be for our love for Doctor Who, our mutual obsession for coffee or even our love of games but i knew that you are an amazing person that i wanted to get to know more of. </p></div>

        <h2 class="animate title-word-2">My Kali</h2>
        <p>Since we started dating, you have always made me happy. Feels like this past year has been one straight adventure. We have done multiple things like go to my best Friends Wedding,the CN Tower 360 restaurant, long walks and even Anime North. Doing all these things, I knew there was no one else i wanted to hold close and have all these events with. Since we started dating you have helped me to look ahead to consider my future and what I wanted in my life and where i wanted it to go. When im around you i feel like my possibilities in life are endless. </p></div>

        <h2 class="animate title-word-3">My BuBu</h2>
        <p>Since we started dating, you have always shown me that there is more to you than just your Whovian love., I saw it what yoy do and your personality. I have always noticed the effectyou have on people around you. I will never forget the time when we were walking doen the street and one of your students yelled out to you from their car. To be able to get that from one of your students outside of the classroom. You have such an innocent heart that looks to help everyone. That is something everyone aone you including your students can see.</p></div>

        <h2 class="animate title-word-4">My Kalista</h2>
        <p>I love you Kalista. I love your smile, your laugh, the way you look at me when you get lost my eyes as much as i get lost in yours. I love being your Dudu and i love that you are my Bubu. I love holding your hands on those long walks. Love spending time with you just watching Drag Race...We really need to finish a season and get to an All Starts season(lol). I can honestly say that i have never been with someone and felt so settled. I have never had it where people are litterally stoping us on the street telling us that we look cute together, that we just look like we work. I am still shocked that we were stopped an escalator haha. I cannot (nor will I) see myself with anyone else. I love you Kalista. Love you to the Moon and Back(and stuff). </p></div>
